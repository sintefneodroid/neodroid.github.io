# Setup

The Neodroid python interface is hosted at Pypi and thus is installable through pip:

```bash
pip3 install -U neodroid
```

Ensure installation was successful, otherwise install missing dependencies. Consult an internet search engine for error messages
If installation was successful, you should now be able run an example environment, directly from your terminal:

```bash
neodroid-mab
```
